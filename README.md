# Questions and Answers - Object-oriented Programming in C# 10

**Course:** [Object-oriented Programming in C# 10](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/c-sharp-10-object-oriented-programming/table-of-contents)

## What is Object-oriented Programming (OOP)?
- Itâ€™s a programming approach that maps real-world models into objects in our code.
- With OOP, we create objects that represent these entities in our applications and map the interactions between these objects.

## Why use OOP?
- OOP makes our code more reusable and easier to maintain.
- OOP helps with solving more complex problems breaking down the problems into smaller parts.

## What are the building blocks for OOP?
The common building blocks are:
- **Classes**: Blueprint for objects.
- **Objects**: Instances of classes.
- **Methods**: Functions within classes.
- **Properties**: Characteristics of objects.
- **Interfaces**: Contracts for classes.

## What is the concept of a Class?
- The concept of a class is how we categorize objects or concepts in the real world into a model in code.
- A Class is the blueprint of an object and is where we define its functionality and the behavior using methods and properties.

## What are the types in the .NET CTS (Common Type System)?
There are 6 types: 
1. Class
2. Enumeration
3. Struct
4. Interface
5. Delegate
6. Record

## What are the four pillars of OOP?
The four principles are:
1. **Abstraction**: Creating a layer of abstraction around the object to expose only essential functionalities.
2. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulating data and functionality inside an object, exposing only certain information using access modifiers.
3. **Inheritance**: Creating a hierarchy in our code to reuse code on related classes.
4. **Polymorphism**: Allowing a method to execute in different forms using virtual and override methods.

## What is the concept of Abstraction?
- Abstraction reduces complexity by exposing only essential functionalities and hiding implementation details.
- Benefits include making it easier for users to work with our class and hiding and securing important functionalities.

## What is the concept of Encapsulation?
- Encapsulation is the way we encapsulate data and functionality inside an object, exposing only certain information using access modifiers.

## What is the concept of Inheritance?
- Inheritance creates a hierarchy to reuse code on related classes.
- We define common functionality on higher-level classes called Parent Classes and reuse or extend it on inheritors, which are the Child Classes.

## What is the concept of Polymorphism?
- Polymorphism allows a method to execute in different forms using virtual and override methods.
- Inheriting classes can provide their own implementation of a method specified in the base class.
